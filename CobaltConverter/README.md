# CobaltConverter
CobaltConverter is a simple tool to make using FFMPEG easier.
This is a pre-alpha release, because I hope to write real GUI software at some point, and the script is the result of work to get familiar with the tool.
## Install
Download&extract ffmpeg from offical site.
remove all files, except ffmpeg.exe, and add this files (from this repo) to the folder:
1. CobaltTranscriber.bat
2. jsonextractor.bat

Run CobaltTranscriber.bat
