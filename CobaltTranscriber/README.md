# CobaltTranscriber
CobaltTranscriber is a simple tool to make using FasterWhisper easier.
This is a pre-alpha release, because I hope to write real GUI software at some point, and the script is the result of work to get familiar with the tool.
## Install
Download&extract whisper-faster.7z from here
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pCmXKJJGFYbZwFA8ThJtduHLytba9NXT/view?ts=65a636ca
(thanks to mitmachim.top users on this files)
put in the extracted folder files of this script:
1. CobaltTranscriber.bat
2. jsonextractor.bat
3. defaults.json


Run CobaltTranscriber.bat

enjoy :)
